Siarad Welsh-English bilingual corpus, first edition
====================================================

This directory contains a Git version control repository for the Siarad Corpus, 2009, from the ESRC Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory and Practice, Bangor University, Wales (http://bilingualism.bangor.ac.uk).

Note that this directory is NOT the published version, which is available from http://bangortalk.org.uk.

The beta files in this directory use the same marking style as the Miami and Patagonia corpora (2012), and are the basis for the second edition of the Siarad corpus, whose working files are at https://github.com/donnekgit/siarad2.

The alpha folder contains the published transcriptions (using the old-style marking) as first committed to version control.

The beta folder contains the files after conversion to the new precode marking.

The autoglossed folder contains the files with a gloss added by the Bangor Autoglosser (http://bangortalk.org.uk/autoglosser.php), with typeset versions in the pdf subfolder.

The corpus files (recordings and transcriptions) are copyright the ESRC Centre, 2012-5, and are released under the GPLv3 or later (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

Linguistic or methodological queries should be addressed to Margaret Deuchar (m.deuchar@gmail.com).

Technical queries should be addressed to Kevin Donnelly (donnekgit).
